    <h1 style="color:brown;"> STORY OF FRIENDSHIP </h1><br>
    <p>There were two friends in the city. Ram and Shyam had been friends for almost eight years now and were cooperative with each other. One day, they decided to go on a beach vacation. The next day, both the boys started their journey. The journey went very well, and the boys reached their destination.

        But they had an argument while they were on their way, and Ram slapped Shyam in the face. Ram was hurt and did not say anything to Shyam at that moment. After they reached the beach, Ram wrote on the sand – “Today, my best friend slapped me”.
        
        After some time, they enjoyed the weather at the beach and spent their time happily. Later, they went into the water to swim. They went into the sea to swim and started swimming. Meanwhile, Ram started to drown. Shyam noticed and saved him, and brought him to the seashore. Now, Ram searched for a stone and wrote on it – “Today, my best friend saved my life”.</p>
